# Python-Video-Game-Correlations-Project
This repository contains the Python code for a project that looked for correlations in data from the video game industry, such as global sales and critic scores. It uses libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Numpy, and was completed in Jupyter Notebook.
